## Goals™ - A New Way of Life – by Roelof

Nah, just kidding, this file is my Goals file for the coming time. These
are things I want to achieve in the coming year or so, on a coding and
management level.

## Goals for 2021

### 1. Improve my knowledge of GitHub

This goal is from the GitHub Universe. They announced some great things
to try out and I'd like to get some hands-on experience.

- [ ] Use GitHub Actions with Environments to build a clean deploy flow
- [ ] Use GitHub Codespaces to get one-click access to the gumbo-millennium/website application from any device
- [ ] Use GitHub Codespaces to launch a Java application I'm trying to build.

### 2. Improve Java skills

Since I want to broaden my horizons and seriously improve my Java knowledge, I'd like to try
out some courses and tutorials to improve my Java language knowledge on the following fronts:

- [ ] Java itself, just get back into it
- [ ] Kotlin, since it seems to be a thing people like
- [ ] Spring Framework and JPA Hibernate, as recommended by Quintor
  - [ ] Result: Build a Spring Rest-API with JPA Hibernate and Spring Boot
    - [ ] CRUD actions via API
    - [ ] Angular front-end
    - [ ] Relational model: Blog with tags and comments
  - [ ] (optional) Purchase the [Learn Spring Data JPA](https://www.baeldung.com/learn-spring-data-jpa-course) course.

### 3. Improve Gumbo Millennium test coverage to 70%

The Gumbo Millennium website ([gumbo-millennium/website](https://github.com/gumbo-millennium/website)) project is currently
at a super low code coverage percentage. If I seriously clean up the codebase, and rework the enrollment system, the
reliability goes up /and/ the application will be easier to transfer to someone else.

- [ ] Rework the enrollment system:
  - [ ] Write front-end in Vue
  - [ ] Handle enrollment as API
  - [ ] Add tests for the API
- [ ] Add a ton of documentation using Larecipe (already installed)
